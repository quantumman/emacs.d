;; Buffer-local variables

(defvar shm-decl-asts nil
  "This is partly an optimization and partly for more
functionality. We could parse the whole module, but that would be
wasteful and expensive to lookup nodes every time we want a
node. So it's cheaper to have the granularity of lookup start at
the declaration's point and the node's span.

Second it's better because a module may have unparseable content
in it, but that doesn't mean we don't want structured editing to
stop working on declarations that are fine. I've found in my use
of SHM that this is a common use-case worth taking into account.")

This is purely based on alignments. If anything is aligned after
the current column, then it's assumed to be a child of whatever
has recently changed at POINT, and thus we 'bring it along'
either forwards or backwards.

The algorithm isn't quite comprehensive, it needs special cases
for top-level functions and things like that."

  "Insert, indented in The Right Way. Calls DO-INSERT to do the insertion.

This function assumes a certain semantic meaning towards the
contents of the kill ring. That is,

do bar
   mu

Is an expression which, when pasted, into

main =

should yield,

main = do bar
          mu

Which is so convenient it changes the way you work. However,
there is also the other case:

  do
bar
mu

This is what happens when you have expressions whose children
hang on the underside, and thus pasting these can be done in two
ways: (1) the above way, (2) or like this:

main = do
  bar
  mu

I.e. take the parent into account and try to re-paste an
underside dangling expression. I don't like this style. With SHM
this style becomes pointless and in fact detrimental. It's much
easier to read and manipulate children who are next to their
parents. But one must compromise and conform to some styles no
matter how poorly reasoned.

We can actually give the option for people to pick and choose
this underside dangling vs not. But that will be implemented as a
separate function rather than hard-coded into this one specific
operation."

This normalizes everything it kills assuming what has been killed
is a node or set of nodes. Indentation is stripped off and
preserved appropriately so that if we kill e.g.

foo = {do bar
          mu}

where {} indicates the current node, then what is put into the kill ring is:

do bar
   mu

rather than what is normally put there,

do bar
          mu

So this is nice to paste elsewhere outside of Emacs, but it's
especially nice for pasting back into other parts of code,
because the yank function will take advantage of this
normalization and paste and re-indent to fit into the new
location. See `shm/yank' for documentation on that."
